# Advent of code 2020
In which I attempt to (re)learn some Rust and attempt to solve some fun coding problems.

# Day 1
OK, so I said Rust, but I didn't even get started till past midnight and I'm very tired. So an utterly hideous python script it is. No prizes for elegance, and I'm too tired to even check it for correctness, but whatever - it gave me the right answer. Just don't read the code - it'll make your eyes bleed.
