# Advent of code 2020
In which I attempt to (re)learn some Rust and attempt to solve some fun coding problems.

# Day 1
OK, so I said Rust, but I didn't even get started till past midnight and I'm very tired. So an utterly hideous python script it is. No prizes for elegance, and I'm too tired to even check it for correctness, but whatever - it gave me the right answer. Just don't read the code - it'll make your eyes bleed.

# Day 2
Sheesh. Another midnight start. Another non-Rust attempt. Wrote a better Python program for this one, but still a bit rubbish and lazy with the OO (should have put the functions in the class I made) and I'm now too lazy to change it even though it'll only take 5 minutes. Hopefully tomorrow I'll start early enough to get all rusty on the next problem's ass. Time for bed. Oh, yeah and I managed to misread both part 1 and part 2 to the point of inputing the wrong answer for each one. D'oh! For part 1 I understood "how many bad passwords?" and part 2 "or" instead of "xor".

# Day 3
OK - Python again, but I've actually got some time now to go back to day 1 and rewrite in Rust. I'll probably do this till I get happy writing Rust and can drop the Python. Reasonably happy with my little script this time. I got part 1 out in 18 minutes (yes, stately, I admit), but part 2 only 3:30 minutes later (ooh, speedy!) - I'd anticipated I'd need to do something similar for different x/y translation strategies in part 1. Smug. Then I looked at the global leaderboard. Sigh. The best got the first star after 1:45, then the second at 2:33. 48 seconds. Sheesh.
