# Advent of code 2020
In which I attempt to (re)learn some Rust and attempt to solve some fun coding problems.

# Day 1
OK, so I said Rust, but I didn't even get started till past midnight and I'm very tired. So an utterly hideous python script it is. No prizes for elegance, and I'm too tired to even check it for correctness, but whatever - it gave me the right answer. Just don't read the code - it'll make your eyes bleed.

# Day 2
Sheesh. Another midnight start. Another non-Rust attempt. Wrote a better Python program for this one, but still a bit rubbish and lazy with the OO (should have put the functions in the class I made) and I'm now too lazy to change it even though it'll only take 5 minutes. Hopefully tomorrow I'll start early enough to get all rusty on the next problem's ass. Time for bed. Oh, yeah and I managed to misread both part 1 and part 2 to the point of inputing the wrong answer for each one. D'oh! For part 1 I understood "how many bad passwords?" and part 2 "or" instead of "xor".

# Day 3
OK - Python again, but I've actually had some time left over to learn some Rust (just a little bit, a few chapters of the Rust book). Plan is, I'll do the day's puzzle in Python and learn Rust on the side. Once I've got enough Rust under my belt, I'll revisit previous days and rewrite the solutions in Rust. Once I get happy implementing those in Rust, I'll drop the Python for the remaining days and go straight to Rust.

Reasonably happy with my little script this time. I got part 1 out in 18 minutes (yes, stately, I admit), but part 2 only 3:30 minutes later (ooh, speedy!) - I'd anticipated I'd need to do something similar for different x/y translation strategies in part 1. Smug. Then I looked at the global leaderboard. Sigh. The best got the first star after 1:45, then the second at 2:33. 48 seconds. Sheesh.

# Day 4
Python solution hacked out at lunchtime. It's ugly, very ugly. Reading my script, you get the same feeling you get after you come back from a walk to discover you've stepped in something very nasty that has become deeply ground into the treads of your new trainers, and you're outside, grimacing, scraping away with an old butter knife under the outdoor tap, hands growing cold, little nuggets of faecal matter slowly washing away down the drain along with your will to live. You don't feel like eating lunch anymore and you don't really want to wear your new trainers anymore. Still, 2 stars is 2 stars.

This evening I might try to learn some more Rust.

# Day 5
Didn't quite make it round to learning more Rust last night as I was knackered and it was a Friday, so, well, beer. And beer, knackeredness and learning Rust don't really mix. Never mind.

So Python again. Quick and filthy script. Job done. Reading the script back feels like an aimless trudge along a muddy, damp, woodland trail. Grey skies through the grey branches. Light fading. Dull and uninteresting, nary a sign of wildlife - the squirrels are in their dreys, the woodpeckers in their nests, the wild boar asleep in their dens. Muddy boots, tired legs. Time to go home and drink some beer.

# Day 6
Oh, for the love of ...

Part 1 ran without error second time of trying (forgot a "self" somewhere) and got the right answer. Part 2 ran first time of trying and got the right answer. But deeply unsatisfied. My code is so pedestrian! Some noddy classes encapsulating a "Group" and a "Person", iterating through people and groups in for loops, sets with basic "if answer not in set of answers". Yawn. Could have been so much more elegantly expressed.

The code is like a well-meaning uncle teaching his teenage nephew how to dance. Though they might be in time to the sedate beat, his moves are dated and awkward. With the Bee Gees playing quietly in the background, he bumbles around the living room, flapping his arms and plodding from side to side like a teacher at a school disco c. 1988, earnestly explaining how cool the nephew will look if he can pull off these moves. The nephew blushes, mumbles his thanks, makes his excuses, and leaves. Everyone feels embarrassed, diminished and somehow soiled by the experience.

The following week at the school disco, his nephew sits listlessly in the corner weeping silently into his cola.

# Day 7
It works. But don't look at it. Please don't look at it.

# Day 8
Pragmatic, like an grizzled old man with massive calloused hands whacking a nail into a plank with a hammer.

But for some reason I wrote a function with a ludicrously long name that took ages to type. Why?

# Day 9
Workmanlike. No nonsense. Brute forcey. Like a George Foreman punch. Or a burger cooked on a George Foreman grill.

# Day 10
You don't need drugs. Just try to understand my code. I certainly don't.

Far out, dude!

# Day 11
All a bit Conway's Game of Life. Respectable solution. Not quite sure why I needed 8 booleans at one point. I probably didn't, but, well, got things to do, places to be.

# Day 12
Gah! Stupid mistake after stupid mistake. Fine in the end.

# Day 13
Abomination.

# Day 14
Ahh, blessed relief after the hellscape of day 13. A day in which I don't have to rediscover and implement Chinese remainder theorem from a position of complete ignorance is a good day. Just a bit of mucking about converting integers to binary strings, doing a bit of iteration here, fiddling with bits there. Some good old fashioned regex abuse. A happy 2-stars-by-end-of-my-lunch-break day.

# Day 15
Very lazy and badly written. Can't be bothered to change it. Maybe some day. Maybe in Rust. On rereading my program I started to drift. A long-forgotten melody started playing in my head. On and on and round and round went the tune. My eyes started to glaze over, the lids began to droop. I woke up with a start in a pool of drool 2 hours later, splitting headache, dry, cracked lips. Sad.
