# Advent of code 2020
In which I attempt to (re)learn some Rust and attempt to solve some fun coding problems.

# Day 1
OK, so I said Rust, but I didn't even get started till past midnight and I'm very tired. So an utterly hideous python script it is. No prizes for elegance, and I'm too tired to even check it for correctness, but whatever - it gave me the right answer. Just don't read the code - it'll make your eyes bleed.

# Day 2
Sheesh. Another midnight start. Another non-Rust attempt. Wrote a better Python program for this one, but still a bit rubbish and lazy with the OO (should have put the functions in the class I made) and I'm now too lazy to change it even though it'll only take 5 minutes. Hopefully tomorrow I'll start early enough to get all rusty on the next problem's ass. Time for bed. Oh, yeah and I managed to misread both part 1 and part 2 to the point of inputing the wrong answer for each one. D'oh! For part 1 I understood "how many bad passwords?" and part 2 "or" instead of "xor".

# Day 3
OK - Python again, but I've actually had some time left over to learn some Rust (just a little bit, a few chapters of the Rust book). Plan is, I'll do the day's puzzle in Python and learn Rust on the side. Once I've got enough Rust under my belt, I'll revisit previous days and rewrite the solutions in Rust. Once I get happy implementing those in Rust, I'll drop the Python for the remaining days and go straight to Rust. 

Reasonably happy with my little script this time. I got part 1 out in 18 minutes (yes, stately, I admit), but part 2 only 3:30 minutes later (ooh, speedy!) - I'd anticipated I'd need to do something similar for different x/y translation strategies in part 1. Smug. Then I looked at the global leaderboard. Sigh. The best got the first star after 1:45, then the second at 2:33. 48 seconds. Sheesh. 

# Day 4
Python solution hacked out at lunchtime. It's ugly, very ugly. Reading my script, you get the same feeling you get after you come back from a walk to discover you've stepped in something very nasty that has become deeply ground into the treads of your new trainers, and you're outside, grimacing, scraping away with an old butter knife under the outdoor tap, hands growing cold, little nuggets of faecal matter slowly washing away down the drain along with your will to live. You don't feel like eating lunch anymore and you don't really want to wear your new trainers anymore. Still, 2 stars is 2 stars.

This evening I might try to learn some more Rust.
